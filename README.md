# CSS
CSS module
CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." It is a stylesheet language used in web development to describe the presentation and layout of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents. CSS enables developers to control the visual appearance of web pages, including elements such as text, colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and more.

Instead of embedding style information directly into HTML elements, which can make the code cluttered and hard to manage, CSS allows you to separate the content (HTML) from its presentation (styling). This separation enhances the maintainability and flexibility of web development projects, as changes to the visual design can be made without altering the underlying content.
